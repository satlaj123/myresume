# :rocket: **Steps to create code based(LaTex) resume in 5 minutes.**
1. Log in to [Overleaf’s Jake’s Resume template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/jakes-resume/syzfjbzwjncs) & [Overleaf’s Name's PHD Resume template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/scismics-recommended-cv-template-for-biotech-and-pharma-jobs/hbnkjrjnnpjz)
.
2. Delete all the existing content from the template.

3. Replace it with the main.tex file from my GitHub repository.

4. Update your email address correctly — many people forget this step, which has caused me to receive invites meant for others.

5. Recompile the updated content on Overleaf.

6. Whoa! You now have a resume identical to mine.

7. Customize it further as per your preference.
